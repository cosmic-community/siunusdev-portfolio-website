## Prompts

This application was built using the following prompts to generate the content structure and code:

### Content Model Prompt

> "Saya akan mengembangkan website dengan Astro, dengan CMS menggunakan Cosmic. Lihat konten website saya sekarang, buatkan apa saja yang perlu dibuat di Cosmic agar konten-konten bisa saya pakai di website saya."

### Code Generation Prompt

> Set up an Astro website powered by my existing content, with clean design, modern and user-friendly, responsive for desktop and mobile, support dark/light mode or based on user's system theme. Use Tailwind CSS so I can customize it in the future.

The app has been tailored to work with your existing Cosmic content structure and includes all the features requested above.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Astro** - Fast, modern static site generator
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **Cosmic** - Headless CMS for content management
- **@cosmicjs/sdk** - Official Cosmic JavaScript SDK

## üìã Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ or Bun runtime
- A Cosmic account with a bucket set up
- Basic knowledge of Astro and TypeScript

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
bun install
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
COSMIC_BUCKET_SLUG=your-bucket-slug
COSMIC_READ_KEY=your-read-key
```

**Important**: The Cosmic environment variables (COSMIC_BUCKET_SLUG, COSMIC_READ_KEY) are automatically included. Never commit your `.env` file to version control.

### 3. Run Development Server

```bash
bun run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:4321` to see your website in action.

### 4. Build for Production

```bash
bun run build
```

The production-ready files will be in the `dist/` directory.

## üìö Cosmic SDK Examples

### Fetching Company Information

```typescript
import { cosmic } from './lib/cosmic'

const { object: companyInfo } = await cosmic.objects
  .findOne({
    type: 'company-info',
    slug: 'siunusdev-company-information'
  })
  .props(['id', 'title', 'metadata'])
  .depth(1)
```

### Fetching Products with Filtering

```typescript
const query: any = { type: 'products' }

// Filter by category if specified
if (category) {
  query['metadata.category.key'] = category
}

const { objects: products } = await cosmic.objects
  .find(query)
  .props(['id', 'title', 'slug', 'metadata'])
  .depth(1)
```

### Fetching Services (Ordered)

```typescript
const { objects: services } = await cosmic.objects
  .find({ type: 'services' })
  .props(['id', 'title', 'metadata'])
  .depth(1)

// Manual sorting by order field
const sortedServices = services.sort((a, b) => {
  const orderA = a.metadata?.order || 0
  const orderB = b.metadata?.order || 0
  return orderA - orderB
})
```

## üé® Customization

The website uses Tailwind CSS for styling. All custom colors and design tokens are defined in `tailwind.config.mjs`:

```javascript
theme: {
  extend: {
    colors: {
      primary: {
        DEFAULT: '#3b82f6',
        dark: '#2563eb',
      },
      // Add your custom colors here
    }
  }
}
```

To customize the design:
1. Edit color values in `tailwind.config.mjs`
2. Modify component styles in the respective `.astro` files
3. Add custom CSS in `src/styles/global.css` if needed

## üì± Responsive Design

The website is fully responsive with breakpoints:
- Mobile: < 640px
- Tablet: 640px - 1024px
- Desktop: > 1024px

All components automatically adapt to different screen sizes.

## üåì Dark Mode

Dark mode is automatically detected based on the user's system preferences using the `prefers-color-scheme` media query. The theme cannot be manually toggled to ensure consistency with the user's system settings.
